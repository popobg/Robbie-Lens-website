This site is inspired from the online free course "Cr√©ez votre site web avec HTML5 et CSS3" available on Openclassrooms.\
However, the design is completely original and I add some new ideas, like the price popup or the photos slider on the "a propos" page. This two elements are additionaly coded in JavaScript.
